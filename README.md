# Symbolic Execution Fuzzing With KLLE


#### What is Symbolic Execution?

symbolic execution is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. 
An interpreter follows the program, assuming symbolic values for inputs rather than obtaining actual inputs as normal execution of the program would.


#### KLEE Symbolic Execution Engine
KLEE is a dynamic symbolic execution engine built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure
